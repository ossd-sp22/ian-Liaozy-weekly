This week, we had our first group project to work on, which requires us to work together and create a Firefox browser extension. Also, we saw other groups‚Äô work on Tuesday, which gave us a lot of inspirations.

This is the first time for me to learn how to develop an extension, so it is a bit challenging for me at first. However, my group members are helpful. Although all of us have not develop any browser extension, we followed the instructions, and work together. I think the most important thing that helps us to develop the add-on extension is working together (in-person). We met together, developed ideas, discussed how to realize them, and finally worked on the code, did testing, and finalized it. 

# My contribution

During our group discussion, I brought up the idea of working on some web pages, and making some useful add-on extensions. We tried to set up the details about our extension, but had some disagreements on the functionality of the extension. Since we are new to add-on development, we decided to make something light on size. 

After that, I saw an interesting Firefox extension called [Clear This Page](https://clearthis.page/). This extension enable user to turn on the ‚Äúread mode‚Äù on web page, to filter out distracting elements on the website, and focus on the main content. Our group members are interested about the extension I found, and we all think that it is realistic to do the coding part. However, it is a close source project. So, we decided to make our own extension on making a clear page. 

# New Things

Developing browser add-on is definitely fresh to me. Even if I think JavaScript is kind of familiar to me, how to make a web extension is different than the JavaScript web development I learnt. 

Also, I think my role in our group work is a new experience. I never thought that I can be a ‚Äúcreator‚Äù in group project, but I actually did. I think I know more about how to keep bringing, finalizing, and detailing my ideas from this group work experience.

# Other groups

Other groups‚Äô presentation also gives us a lot of inspirations. The most inspiring one is [Team 1](https://github.com/ossd-sp22/less-ugly-brightspace), who worked on the dark mode of [BrightSpace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/). For our project, after we developed the clear mode of [instagram](http://www.instagram.com), we tried to work on [Albert](http://albert.nyu.edu/albert_index.html) and [BrightSpace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/), but failed. I think the success of Team 1 could give us the help of working on BrightSpace website. If we collaborate, it would be possible for us to make cool stuff! Other than that, the project [block-off](https://github.com/ossd-sp22/block-off) is also interesting. I think it could be adapted as a study mode extension, to block the entertaining websites.
