# Final Project Group Meeting

This week, we finished our first and second group meeting for final project. We decided to work on [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/), which is an add-on for [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) desktop application. On Thursday, we meet in class and after class, for a total length of 4 hours. 

Overall speaking, the meeting goes very well. We first make sure everyone has set up the environment, and also dependency. Then, we go through the issues in the repositories. Among the issues, we found one that ask if it is possible to make a new “darker” theme. We commented in that issue, saying that we are willing to help them. Then, we began to tried to design the theme. 

After trying for a while, we realized that it is a little bit difficult for us to design a new theme. Instead, design a new color scheme for an existed theme would be more realistic. So, we use a pre-set theme, and set up a new color scheme with “darker” colors, which satisfied the need of the issue we try to fix.

In the last part of our meeting, we request for merge, which was the first time of us doing this step. It takes us for a while, to figure out how to do that. But, we eventually submit the request, and the meeting end successfully.
