ðŸ’¡ Introduction to Code of Conduct in Open Source projects. Why do we need them? What is the difference between them?

</aside>

In the first week, we had an overview of the course Open Source Software Development. Then it comes to the second week, we focus on the Code of Conduct agreement in many Open Source projects. After reading through many different Code of Conduct documents, and discussing with my classmates, I have some thoughts about the Code of Conduct, and the significant influence it makes on the whole community.

## **Letâ€™s [Go](https://go.dev/)! Code of Conduct**

The code of conduct document of the Go project was the first code of conduct I read. It covers many aspects of the project development rules. 

The Go project code of conduct shows the Go project value that the owner of the project encourages every participant to remember as the first part. The second part explicitly shows the rules of the community and the border of the code of conduct agreement. In the end, the document specifically mentions the situation when there is a conflict between participants, and indicates the solution.  

### **Benefits, Contribution, and more...**

Having such a code of conduct document will have more clear instructions for the participant of the project, and it will make people easier to handle tricky situations, such as conflicts. As for the most important part, it could help participants to be aware of if their own right is offended, and be nice to others.

Different from the programming contribution, the code of conduct might not directly improve the quality of the project, or the speed it develops. However, the code of conduct ensures that the community is in a peaceful, and friendly atmosphere. It protects the participants in the project and the open-source community.

### Less is more?

The second code of conduct I read is by [the Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/). Compare to the Go project, it only has the second part of the Go project, which shows the rules of the community and the border of the code of conduct agreement. Less is better? I donâ€™t think so. I think the Go project adds the first and third parts for changes so that the participants will have a more detailed understanding of the code of conduct, and it will help them to develop their passion for building and maintaining the community together.

### Different Format, Same Mission

I also read the code of conduct of [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), it has a different structure and content than the Go project, because this project follows the basic structure of the code of conduct document, but the Go project has developed its own version, with some new ideas.

Different than any of the three documents, Sugar Labsâ€™ code of conduct is based on another code of conduct structure, which is kind of similar to part 1 of Goâ€™s code of conduct ([Gopher values](https://go.dev/conduct#:~:text=respectful%20behavior%20more.-,Gopher%20values,-These%20are%20the)). However, Sugar Labs extend it and has many unique elements, such as its value and mission, and the specific instruction for user/participants.

### **Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines**

I find the code of conduct (named as Participation Guidelines here) of the Mozilla open-source community. Compare to the documents I read from class, it is more similar to Sugar Labsâ€™s code of conduct. It has its own value in the document, and keep updated to keep the contents applicable now. Although its structure is different than the Go project, it covers most content of the Goâ€™ code and conduct, in a different form.
