# Final Project Preparation

This week, we have been assign in groups to finish final project together. On Tuesday, we discussed about the topic choice for the final project, and also the things such as time availability. The discussion going really well. 

Some of my teammate proposed on contributing to pandas library in Python, which is challenging, but also quite relevant to our study on data management (for some of the courses). However, after discussion, we felt that it is not that easy to be the first open source project for us as beginners in this field. Then, I proposed [Spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify), which is the one I chose as the project to analyze. It is an app for users to customize the theme of Spotify. This project is active, interesting, and light. It is easy to understand the code, and it has a complete instruction for contribution.

Also, we chose Thursday 2pm-5pm as our team working time, which is right after our Thursday’s class. Then we set up the goals to achieve in these weeks. We want to start by fixing bug, and then contributes to it by making our own theme for [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/). I am really excited to work on it!

# Tom Callaway’s Speech

On Thursday this week, we have Tom Callaway to share his experience as expert open source project participant/owner. 
Tom works in [Red Hat](http://redhat.com) for almost 20 years! Also, he is the key member in [Fedora Project](https://getfedora.org/). Tom is the one who is really passionate about open source, and his experience can give us a lot of inspiration. I think it is passion that leads him to keeping making great contribution to the whole open source community. It inspired me that for the project I am working on, and the ones that I may encounter in the future, passion may be the most important thing, and the most efficient energy.
